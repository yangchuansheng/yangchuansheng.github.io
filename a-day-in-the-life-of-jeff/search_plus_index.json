{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction 何为Podcast？   Podcast是一种基于苹果公司的iTunes软件传播的网络广播，在国外非常流行。各大广播公司都会定期发布自己的Podcast，其音质和资源比radio（广播）要丰富得多。里面有个教育频道，一直以来在教育频道中排名第一的就是ESLPOD。 何为ESLPOD？   ESLPod.com的英语学习播客（Podcast）一直在Apple iTunes商店的英语语言类播客中排名第一，深受世界各国英语学习者的喜爱，也广受英语教育机构赞扬。自2005年开播以来，听众已经遍布全球各地，达数百万人以上。   这个播讲类材料由南加州大学Dr.Jeff McQuillan带领团队编辑制作，8年来，面向全世界提供免费的英文教学广播——Jeff博士本人既是团队领导，也是节目的首席主播。   每期的播客自成一课，每一课全长大约20分钟，一般每课的模式是： 一开始先是简单介绍这一课的内容主题。 之后是Jeff博士专门编写的一小段慢速的对话（男女双人对话）或故事，为1∼3分钟。 然后，Jeff博士会用非常缓慢的语速对这段小对话或者故事进行讲解，这也是每一课的主体，播讲的录音在10分钟以上，讲解的重点主要是句子中的重点词汇、习惯用法以及文化习惯等，融入了美国文化、习俗俚语等知识，既实用又有趣。 讲解完毕之后，节目会以正常的语速把开头的对话正文重新播放一遍，帮助听者在已经对内容熟悉的基础上进一步巩固和强化听力能力。   到目前为止，ESLPOD已经出了800多期，选材非常丰富，涵盖了生活的各个方面，包括生活、商务、人情、娱乐、旅游、购物、健康／医药、交通以及餐饮等，而且每一期主题都有所不同，全部都是最鲜活的生活语料，和大家平时见到的情景对话书完全不同，这和Jeff博士本身的深厚语言功底和丰富的ESL教学经验是分不开的。   ESLPOD每一期都提供极其地道、我们在课本上学不到的英文表达，因为它独特的课程设置风格（慢速朗读，慢速讲解，快速朗读），给大家提供了一个从慢速英语向快速英语过渡的完美平台。个人感觉比VOA Special English（VOA慢速英语）要好用很多，而且它的词汇量也非常丰富，大约是6000个常用的英文，比VOA慢速英语始终局限在3000个以内的词汇量要丰富得多。   但是ESLPOD课程并不是毫无缺点的，因为是广播式的英文，所以缺乏系统性，比较零散，而且不容易量化自己的学习效果，感觉好像一辈子都要学习这个播客一样，而且800多期都听完也实在要花费太多时间，也让学习者不知道什么时候算学完，可以进入下一个阶段。   这个时候，我们推荐你使用系统化的教材来学习——ESLPOD团队出版了几本系列教材，注意是系统的教材而不是现在出的几百期没有系统的广播。   打开他们的官网，你很容易就能找到他们的收费教材，其中对我们比较有用的是以下几本： Introduction to the United States（《美国简介》） A Day in the Life of Jeff（《杰夫的一天》） A Day in the Life of Lucy（《露西的一天》） Interview Questions Answered（《面试问题回答》） English for Business Meetings（《英文会议》） Using English at Work（《工作常用英文》）   看名字就知道每本书相对应的主题。虽然在网上都有盗版的书籍下载，但我们还是强烈建议大家尽量购买正版书籍来学习和使用，因为只有买来的才能保证你好好珍惜，认真学完，而不是下载完了扔到硬盘里睡大觉。 ESLPOD 六本教材简介   本教材按照种类划分，可以分成3大类，下面我们来对每本教材稍微详细地介绍一下： 第一类：学术类 Introduction to the United States（《美国简介》）   本书共100个音频，每个音频8分钟左右，由Jeff和Lucy两位老师穿插播报，播报模式很统一。前6分钟是慢速内容，后两分钟是常速的内容，两部分内容一模一样：虽然名为常速，但其实也是很容易的，只比慢速的快一点点。慢速用来仔细模仿跟读，使正确的发音深入骨髓，形成习惯，快速的可以挑战下你的听力口语能力，努力跟上。   教材文本共200多页，是整个系列教材中最厚的一本，一本书相当于其他两三本的内容，内容结构很简单。与其说这本书是美国简介，不如说是美国常识100问，每个音频就是讲一个问题的答案，100个问题涵盖了美国生活的方方面面。但这些介绍，并不是我们熟悉的那些所谓美国小常识之类的无聊问题，什么美国天气如何啦、美国人一般吃什么东西啦之类的，Jeff博士选取的问题，都是最根本的、你必须了解的东西，我们节选前五个问题举例说明吧。 What is the supreme law of the land?（美国本土的最高法律是什么？） What does the Constitution do?（美国的宪法主要用途是什么？） The idea of self-government is in the first three words of the Constitution. What are these words?（宪法中前三个字就提出来“民主政府”的概念，请问是哪三个字？） What is an amendment?（什么是宪法修正案？） What do we call the first 10 amendments to the Constitution?（我们把宪法的前10条修正案称为什么？）   整本书涵盖了美国的政治制度、法律、经济、地理、日常生活等各个方面，而且课程设置非常棒。全书分成100课，对应的是100个音频，每一课都有附带的glossary（词汇表）。这个glossary也排列得非常完美，全部都是英文解释英文，对于培养直接的英文即时反应能力和英语语感的帮助特别大。本书比较适合英语专业或者需要去美国留学的同学学习，可以在很大程度上达到美国常识扫盲的作用，但对美国的情况不太感兴趣的同学就不是特别适合了。 第二类：生活类 A Day in the Life of Jeff（《杰夫的一天》） A Day in the Life of Lucy（《露西的一天》）   一本是男生的一天，一本是女生的一天。课程设置的目的很简单：Jeff博士在前言中说的，to teach you everyday vocabulary, from getting up in the morning to going to bed at night2，教会一个普通人每天都要遇到的场景和场景下的词汇与表达法。从每天的起床开始，讲到一天结束，上床睡觉，中间遇到的任何场景下设计的表达法都会进行细致讲解。课程分成三个部分，慢速的课文朗读，然后是针对课文里面难点单词和短语的讲解，最后是常速的课文朗读。   A Day in the Life of Jeff一共有10课，共3个小时，讲述的是Jeff的一天，里面的单词对男生来说非常实用，都是你平时在课本中难见到、看美剧又不太会注意到的，比如说洗手间的水槽sink、漱口gargle、牙线floss、洗完头发的漂洗动作rinse、电动剃须刀electric razor、一次性刀片disposable blades、腰带扣buckle等。基本上学完了这本书，和男生平时活动有关的表达方法就都会了。   A Day in the Life of Lucy格式和内容都和A Day in the Life of Jeff类似，但是单词主要是关于女孩子的生活，比如说吹风机hairdryer、卫生棉tampon、护发素conditioner、泡泡浴bubble bath、睫毛膏mascara、眼影eye shadow、刘海bangs、连裤袜pantyhose等。   这两本书编排得非常棒，而且非常生活化和实用，建议想要提高生活化口语的同学购买这两本。 第三类：商务类 A．Interview Questions Answered（《面试问题回答》）   这本是我见过最好的有关英文面试的教材，全书共80页，目的就是to teach you the English you need to know to have a successful interview（教会你有关英文面试的一切）。书里面涉及的问题都是英文面试中最常见的问题，全书一共有三个音频，共分成了6课。每一课分成了4个部分：首先，本书会提供给你一些很重要的tips（小提示），来怎么回答这些问题；然后，录音会提供给你两个比较好的针对问题的回答例子，这些回答都是使用他们提供的tips来成功回答的，每个范例都是用慢速朗读一遍；接着是Jeff博士针对每个回答的重难点语句和生词讲解；最后是常速地把问题答案朗读一遍。每一课都有对应的PDF，包含了所有的tips、所有的生词表以及讲解录音的全文。   书中提到的面试六大问题包括： a．Tell me about yourself.（自我介绍） b．Why did you leave your last job?/Why are you looking for a new job?（为什么辞去你上一份工作？/为什么要找一个新工作？） c．Why do you want to work here?（你对我们这份工作的意向度如何？） d．Where do you see yourself in five years?（你5年内的职业规划如何？） e．What are your strengths?（你最擅长什么？） f．What are your weaknesses?（你不擅长什么？）   这六大问题确实是HR面试时最常用的六个问题，每个问题书中都揉碎了细细讲述。这本书特别好的地方就在于，它不像任何一本所谓的“商务英语”书籍，纯粹是为了教英文而教英文，它的tips教给你的不是英文，而是谈话技巧和说话策略，来帮助你顺利回答好问题。它提供的面试问题回答范例，都是最地道的英文表达，而且也是非常好的参考范例。这些内容国内没有任何一本商务英文书籍提及过，商务英语老师也没教过——大部分老师都没有在商业公司工作过的经验，其实他们自己都不知道应该怎么去面试。   从这本书里也可以学到很多跟商务有关的词汇，比如说大学专业major in、实习internship、高效effectively、结果导向resultoriented、考核evaluation等。   另外问大家一个问题，面试时说自己成绩优秀怎么说？   很简单，“I excelled in all of my courses at school”就行了。   但正是这些很简单的句子，很多人都不知道，导致面试时言不尽意。 B．English for Business Meetings（《英文会议》）   这本书共10课，共121页，算是《面试问题回答》那本教材的扩展。这本书中对商业词汇和短语用法收录得更多，设置的目的就是让你学会各种正式和不正式的商业场合词汇。每一课都有三部分：首先是慢速朗读课程内容；然后是慢速地讲解这段话中的重难点和生词；最后是常速地再把课程朗读一遍。这本书特别好的地方还在于，每一课的meeting录音都有两个版本——正式版和不是特别正式的，可以让大家对不同商业场合下的用词得到最好的理解。   这本书明显是Jeff博士赚了钱、有了充分的经济实力后所作的高水准作品，但相对课程难度也高了不少。课程编排非常合理，而且录音质量非常好，聘请了专业的录音者而不是Jeff博士本人来录制meeting录音。   书中提到一些单词，比如评估assessment、潜在市场potential market、创新innovative、目标市场target market。它把职场中的表达都分成了formal（正式）和informal（非正式）两类，讲解录音非常用心，教材也都有glossary。 C．Using English at Work（《工作常用英文》）   这本书可能是三本书中最简单的书了，一共10课，目的是教会大家寻常职场中的常见英文。每一课有三个部分，首先是一段慢速的职场对话，然后是Jeff博士对这段对话的慢速讲解，最后用常速把刚才的对话再播报一遍，这是最典型的ESLPOD的模式。   这本书最闪亮的地方在于，和我们寻常见到的商务英语书不同，它没有任何的cliche（陈词滥调），目录就说明了一切： Lesson 1-Arriving at Work（第一课——上班） Lesson 2-Checking Mail, E-mail, and Voicemail（第二课——收发邮件） Lesson 3-Attending the Morning Meeting（第三课——参加早会） Lesson 4-Working at My Desk（第四课——案头工作） Lesson 5-Taking a Break and Eating Lunch（第五课——休息下，吃个午餐） Lesson 6-Having Computer Problems（第六课——电脑故障） Lesson 7-Scheduling a Meeting（第七课——预约开会） Lesson 8-Meeting With the Boss（第八课——和老板开会） Lesson 9-Leaving Work（第九课——下班） Lesson 10-Socializing With Coworkers（第十课——和同事社交）   看到了？它的10节课全部都是按照一整天的工作流程的时间顺序来设计的，虽然不可能囊括你所有的工作用语，但是全部都是最实用的表达法，学了一课立刻就可以用的！比如说：card reader读卡器、parking spot停车位、spam垃圾邮件、stapler订书机、paper clip曲别针、scan扫描等。看到这本书的glossary，你就能感觉得到一种浓浓的典型的职场白领味儿了。 后记   本书由杨传胜整理，包含了《A Day in the Life of Jeff》的完整录音文本,并提供不同格式的文本下载： pdf epub mobi "},"part1/":{"url":"part1/","title":"Episode 1 - Getting Up","keywords":"","body":"Episode 1 - Getting Up "},"part1/glossary.html":{"url":"part1/glossary.html","title":"生词详解","keywords":"","body":"GLOSSARY to get up – to get out of bed; to leave one’s bed   This morning I got up very quickly because the baby was crying. to wake up – to awaken; to stop sleeping   She always leaves her curtains open so that she can wake up with the sunlight. to handle – to manage; to deal with; to control   Are you sure that you can handle taking six classes this semester?

This is Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, and I'll be the host for this series. In this course, you'll learn the vocabulary for everyday actions, from getting up in the morning to going to bed at night and everything in between. Each lesson has three parts: first, a story read slowly; second, an explanation of the story and the vocabulary we use; and third, the story read at a normal speed. Are you ready? Let's begin with lesson one: “Getting Up.” [Start of story] The worst part of the day for me is definitely when I have to get up. Waking up, that I can handle. But getting up? That, I hate. The covers I have on my bed are heavy, mostly because I have a comforter as well as a light blanket. I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have different color pillowcases. Well, at least the sheets match. I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off. I like to keep the alarm at a low volume, with some classical music, nothing too jarring. My old roommate used to like the terrible buzzer that you find on most alarm clocks nowadays, which always used to drive me nuts. As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the house—a car door slamming, an alarm going off, gunfire—well, okay, not gunfire, but man, is my neighborhood noisy! Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’s usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel than set the alarm. I’m not really an early riser, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to take on the world. I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the floor at a time. Every once in awhile I’ll oversleep, but not too often. I really love the weekends, when I can sleep in. [End of story] Our story begins by me describing how much I do not like getting up. To get up means to get out of your bed, to stand up after you have been lying down on a bed. I say that, “The worst part of my day is when I have to get up. Waking up, that I can handle.” To wake up, “wake up,” (two words) means that you are sleeping and you stop sleeping and now you are awake. The verb is to wake up. So, you can wake up while you are in bed, and then, you get up—you stand up after lying down. I said that “waking up” is something “that I can handle.” To handle, “handle,” here means to be able to control—something that I can manage—something that I can accept; it's not a problem. Another expression would be something I can deal with. To deal, “deal,” with something is the same, in this case, as to be able to handle something. I say that “getting up” is something that “I hate. The covers I have on my bed are heavy.” The covers, “covers,” are the things that you put over you to keep you warm. Usually, the covers include a blanket, sometimes a comforter and usually, what we would call the top sheet or flat sheet. A comforter, “comforter,” is a very thick blanket—a very heavy blanket. A blanket, “blanket,” is something that you put over you when you are sleeping to keep you warm. Blanket is a general term; a comforter is a kind of blanket—a heavy blanket. The opposite of a comforter would be a light blanket. A light, “light,” blanket would be the opposite, and that is a blanket that will keep you warm, but if it gets very cold, it might not keep you warm—it might not be sufficient. So, we have a comforter and we have a light blanket. Usually, there is a top sheet, “sheet,” that you put over you in between your body and the blankets, and this top sheet is sometimes called a flat sheet. The sheet that goes on the bed itself—that goes onto the corners of the bed—that's called a fitted sheet, a fitted, “fitted,” sheet. So, we have a fitted sheet on the bed that you sleep on top of, then we have a top sheet and then a blanket, sometimes, if it's very cold, a comforter as well. I say in the story that “I sleep with two pillows.” A pillow, “pillow,” is what you put your head on when you sleep. Now, “for some reason,” I say I “have different colored pillowcases.” This is true, actually; I have a black pillowcase and a blue pillowcase for my two pillows. I think the reason is I am too lazy to go and buy a new pillowcase. Well, the pillowcase, “pillowcase,” (one word) is the thing that you put over the pillow so the pillow doesn't get dirty; we call that the pillowcase. I say, “Well, at least the sheets match.” We already know what a sheet is. When we say the sheets match, “match,” we mean that they are the same color or two colors that look good together. We use that verb, to match, when we are talking about clothing as well, or anything where you have two colors. “I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off.” When we say the alarm goes off, we mean that the alarm starts to make a sound. Your alarm, “alarm,” is a machine that makes noise at a certain time; usually it has a clock. Well, “I sometimes wake up before my alarm” makes noise—my alarm goes off. “I like to keep the alarm at a low volume,” meaning not very loud, “at a low volume, with some classical music, nothing too jarring.” When we say a sound is jarring, “jarring,” we mean that it is loud and it causes you to jump or to be surprised. It's something that is not very nice—not very pleasant. A jarring noise would be one that bothers you, perhaps because it is very loud or it is not a very nice sound. So, I don't want my alarm to have a jarring noise, instead I play classical music. Now, “My old roommate”—the person I used to share an apartment with—”used to like the terrible buzzer you find on most alarm clocks.” This, again, is true. I had a roommate that had a very loud and bad sounding buzzer; it was a terrible buzzer. The buzzer, “buzzer,” is when the alarm clock doesn't play music, but it just plays a sound. Sometimes it is like a bell ringing; that's the buzzer. Well, this buzzer “always used to drive me nuts.” To drive someone nuts, “nuts,” means to drive them crazy—to make them crazy—to make them go crazy. I continue the story by saying, “As I was saying.” We use that expression, as I was saying, when we are talking about one thing then we start talking about a second thing, and now we want to go back and talk about the first thing again. So, when you interrupt yourself when you are talking, and then you change the topic—change what you are talking about—and then want to go back to your original topic, you say, “As I was saying.” “As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the house.” When we say there is some noise—some sound—outside the house or outside of the house—you can say either one—we mean that someone is making a noise that is very loud. Some of those noises are “a car door slamming.” The verb, to slam, “slam,” means that you close the door usually very quickly and you make a loud noise. Someone closes their car door very fast, it will make a noise; we call that “slamming the door.” My mother always used to tell me when I was young, “Don't slam the doors,” meaning when I come in and close the door, I should close it slowly and quietly. Of course, I was not a good boy so I would sometimes slam the door. As I was saying, an alarm goes off, that's another noise that can wake you up outside and this would be a car alarm. Here, in Los Angeles, everyone has a car alarm, and sometimes those alarms go off at night. Another noise is gunfire; gun, “gun,” fire, “fire.” Gunfire is when someone shoots a gun and it makes a noise. This is, again, Los Angeles, so we sometimes have gunfire but of course, I'm joking. I say, “well, okay, not gunfire,” meaning I'm just kidding—that isn't actually true, although, it is true sometimes. I then say, “Man, is my neighborhood noisy!” That expression, “man,” is just a way of expressing your emotion when you are saying something that you really mean or really want to emphasize. “Man, is my neighborhood noisy,” that means my neighborhood is very noisy. “Of course, when I'm staying at a hotel, it’s usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel.” A wake up call, “call,” is when the hotel calls you on the phone to wake you up, so you don't have to set your own alarm. To set, “set,” an alarm means to turn it on and to put a certain time that you want to get up. Well, sometimes people have problems with their alarm clocks and so, if they are in a hotel, they can ask the hotel to wake them up with a wake up call. At the end of the story I say, “I’m not really an early riser.” An early, “early,” riser, “riser,” means someone who wakes up and gets up very early in the morning. You could be an early riser; you could be a late riser. The word riser comes from the verb to rise, “rise,” which, in this case, means to get up. Well, “I'm not really an early riser,” I say, “so I don’t jump out of bed.” To jump out of bed means to get out of bed very quickly. “I don’t jump out of bed ready to take on the world.” “To take on the world,” means I'm ready for the day. It's an expression we use to say that I am ready to go out into the world and do my best. “I'm not an early riser, I don't jump out of bed ready to take on the world.” Instead, “I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the floor at a time.” So first, I get up and I put one foot on the floor and then another foot on the floor, and then I stand up. “Every once in awhile,” I say, “I’ll oversleep.” To oversleep, “oversleep,” (one word) means that you sleep later than you should. For example, you are wanting to get up at seven o'clock in the morning and you sleep until 7:30. You don't realize that you are sleeping too late; we call that oversleeping. To oversleep means that you sleep longer than you wanted to. At the end of the story I say, “I really love the weekends,” Fridays and Saturdays, “when I can sleep in.” To sleep in means that you don't get up at your normal time; you sleep longer than you normally do. So, if you normally get up at seven, on Saturday or Sunday if you don't work, you may sleep in until nine a.m. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech. [Start of story] The worst part of the day for me is definitely when I have to get up. Waking up, that I can handle. But getting up? That, I hate. The covers I have on my bed are heavy, mostly because I have a comforter as well as a light blanket. I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have different color pillowcases. Well, at least the sheets match. I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off. I like to keep the alarm at a low volume, with some classical music, nothing too jarring. My old roommate used to like the terrible buzzer that you find on most alarm clocks nowadays, which always used to drive me nuts. As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the house—a car door slamming, an alarm going off, gunfire—well, okay, not gunfire, but man, is my neighborhood noisy! Of course, when I’m staying in a hotel, it’s usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel than set the alarm. I’m not really an early riser, so I don’t jump out of bed ready to take on the world. I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the floor at a time.

In the first episode of “A Day in the Life of Jeff,” I talked about how I get up every morning. In part two, we're going to talk about “Cleaning Up,” what you do in the morning to get ready to eat and go to work. Let's get started. [Start of story] I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 a.m. My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The toilet is next to that, with the tub in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet. I pour a small amount into a cup, swish it around for 30 seconds, gargle, and spit. Not pleasant, but necessary. Then I get out the floss. When I’m done flossing, I pull out the toothbrush and the toothpaste. I brush and then it’s off to the shower. I pull the shower curtain aside, step into the tub, and pull the curtain back. I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the perfect temperature. I lather up with soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then rinse and dry off. Now it’s shaving time. I used to own an electric razor, but I found it didn’t shave close enough. So now I’m back to the old hand razor. I lather up with shaving cream, and I start to shave. I rinse the razor and throw the disposable blades in the trash. It’s about 7:00 AM, and I’m on to breakfast. [End of story] In this episode, we are “Cleaning Up,” or making ourselves clean. “I go into my bathroom,” I begin the story, “sometime around 6:45 a.m.” Notice that we say a.m., but you could also say, “in the morning.” 6:45 is also the same as quarter to seven. “My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom.” In your bathroom and in your kitchen there is usually a sink and a faucet. The faucet, “faucet,” is where the water comes out, and normally you have hot water and cold water. The sink is where the water goes into. Usually, it is a round or a square white bowl, really, that has a hole at the bottom and we call that hole the drain, “drain.” That's where the water goes down into the pipe—it's where the water goes out of the sink. If you want to fill your sink with water, you usually have to stop the drain. To stop a drain means to put something over it so that the water doesn't go down. So, we have a faucet and we have a sink, and in your bathroom, you often have a small box, sometimes with a mirror on it so you can see yourself, that we call the medicine cabinet. A cabinet, “cabinet,” is like a small box where you put things, but it's a box that hangs on the wall—it is attached to the wall. You can have cabinets in your kitchen, where you put your dishes. So, they're containers—they're things that you used to put and store or keep things. A medicine cabinet is a place where you have medicine, but also, it's a place where you put your other things that you use in the bathroom; things like mouthwash, shaving cream, razors and so forth. We'll talk about those in a second. So, that's your medicine cabinet. In my bathroom, the “sink and the medicine cabinet are on the left” side when you walk into the bathroom, “the toilet is next to that to.” The toilet, “toilet,” is what you use to go to the bathroom—what you use to get rid of things from your body, we might say. When you are done using the toilet, you then flush the toilet. The verb, to flush, “flush,” is when you get rid of what's inside the toilet after you're done using it, usually with water. There is a tub in my bathroom. A tub, “tub,” sometimes called a bathtub, is where you can take a bath. You can fill the tub up with water and you can get into the water. “Anyway,” I say in the story, “I turn on the lights.” Notice the use of the word “anyway.” It's common in English to use that word when you want to get back to something you were talking about before. We can also say, “as I was saying,” it means something similar here. “Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet.” The mouthwash, “mouthwash,” (all one word) is a liquid like water, but it has something in it that helps clean your teeth—clean the inside of your mouth; that is mouthwash. So, you take the mouthwash and you “pour a small amount into a cup.” The mouthwash usually comes in, or is in, a bottle. This bottle, you take and you pour some mouthwash into a cup. To pour means to take something that is liquid, like water or mouthwash, and put it somewhere else. In this case, it's into a small cup. After it put it into the cup, I “swish it around for 30 seconds.” To swish, “swish,” something around means to move it around, and we use that verb usually when talking about something that is liquid like water or mouthwash that you move back and forth very quickly. So, when you put the mouthwash in your mouth, usually you take your sides of your mouth, what we would call your cheeks, “cheeks,” your cheeks and you move them back and forth, so that the mouthwash covers and cleans all of your teeth. After “I swish it around,” I “gargle.” The verb to gargle, “gargle,” means to take water and to put it into your back of your mouth. I will have to demonstrate this; it's easier to understand if you can hear it. [Gargling sound] That's to gargle. That's just an extra little bonus for listening to this episode; you get to hear me gargle! Well, after I gargle, I have to get rid of or remove the water from my mouth, and I do that by spitting. To spit, “spit,” means to take something that's liquid, like water, and to remove it from your mouth. Usually, you make a certain sound like [spitting sound]; something like that. Well, now we've gargled and spit. I say these are “Not pleasant, but necessary.” Not necessarily something nice but something I have to do. After I use the mouthwash, “Then I get out,” or take out, “the floss.” Floss, “floss,” is a piece of string that you put in between your teeth to clean; we call that floss. And, there's a verb, to floss, which means to use that little piece of string. “When I’m done flossing,” when I'm finished flossing, “I pull out,” or take out, “the toothbrush and the toothpaste.” The toothbrush is what you use to clean your teeth; the toothpaste is like the soap that you use to clean your teeth. But, we do not call it tooth soap; we call it toothpaste. It comes in a container that we call a tube, and the tube, “tube,” is where the toothpaste is, and you usually squeeze the tube, “squeeze,” to get the toothpaste out of the tube. So, I put some toothpaste on my toothbrush and then I brush. We use that verb, to brush, to mean to clean my teeth. But, we don't say, “I'm going to clean my teeth,” usually, we say, “I'm going to brush my teeth.” That same verb, to brush, can also be used with your hair, when you are trying to put your hair in a certain place—a certain position. I don't brush my hair, of course, because I don't have any hair, but I used to, when I was younger, brush my hair. I finished brushing my teeth, so now I'm going to take a shower. There's a difference between taking a shower, where the water comes from the top of the wall and goes over you, and a bath, which means to fill your bathtub with water and get in. Most American homes have the tub and the shower in one place. Some homes have a separate shower and a separate tub. In the story, I say that “I pull the shower curtain aside.” The curtain, “curtain,” is what you use to keep the water in the shower from going onto the floor. It prevents the water from leaving the shower area. We use that word, curtain, also for the things that you can put over your window in your house or apartment, so nobody can see inside; that's also called a curtain. Well, “I pull the shower curtain aside,” meaning I put it to one side—the left side or the right side. I “step into the tub, and I pull the curtain back,” I put it back in its original position. “I turn on both the hot and the cold water.” To turn on means that I turn the faucet on so that the water comes out. Remember, the faucet is where water comes out for a sink; it's also where the water comes out for a tub or a shower. Actually, for the shower—the top of the shower, we don't normally call that a faucet, we call that a showerhead, “head.” So, the showerhead is where the water comes out when you're taking a shower. And, if you are drawing a bath, meaning if you are putting water into your tub to take a bath—to draw a bath—then you use the faucet. The water comes out of the faucet spout, “spout,” that's the part of the faucet where the water actually comes out of. I step into the shower, I turn on “the hot and cold water, looking for the perfect temperature,” not too hot, not too cold. “I lather up with soap.” To lather, “lather,” or to lather up, means to take soap and put it on your skin and then put water on it, and you rub the soap and the water together until you make little bubbles— until the soap and water covers your skin. That is to lather or to lather up. Well, “I lather up with” some “soap,” and then I “put some shampoo in my hair.” Shampoo, “shampoo,” is the soap for your head—for your hair, if you have hair. So, you take this special soap, usually it is a liquid soap, and you put it on your hair and that is called shampoo. You can also lather up your shampoo. You take your hands and you move them back and forth quickly, and that would lather up your shampoo. Well, after you do that, then you have to get rid of the soap and the shampoo, and you do that by rinsing. To rinse, “rinse,” means to take water and get rid of the soap and the shampoo that are on your body. After you do that, then you have to dry your body off. To dry off means the same as to dry, but we use that expression, to dry off, to mean to dry, in this case, your body with a towel. Now, it is time for me to shave. To shave, “shave,” means to remove hair, usually from your face. If you are a man and you don't shave, you will grow a beard and a mustache; you will have hair on your face. Well, I don't like beards and mustaches, so I shave—I use something to get rid of the hair. The thing I use to get rid of the hair is the razor, “razor.” A razor is like a knife, it has a blade, “blade,” and the blade is the thing that actually cuts the hair—that removes the hair. So, you have a razor that you use to shave the whiskers from your face. A whisker, “whisker,” is the name we give the hair on your face, at least for a man, we call those whiskers. So, you can have an electric razor, like I used to have, or you can have a hand razor. A hand razor is one that is not electric that you just take and you shave by moving the razor back and forth on your face. Before I shave, I have to “lather up with shaving cream.” We already know that word, lather up, it means to mix the soap with water and make bubbles so that it spreads across your skin. Shaving cream, “cream,” is the special kind of soap or special kind of liquid material that you put on your face to make it easier for you to shave, so you don't cut yourself or hurt yourself when you are shaving. “I rinse the razor” after I am done shaving, and I “throw the disposable blades in the trash.” The blades are the things that go on top of the razor that cut the whiskers, or remove the whiskers. Disposable, “disposable,” comes from the verb to dispose, “dispose,” which means to throw away—to put in the trash—to put in the garbage. That is disposable. If something is disposable, you use it once or twice and then you it throw away. Well, these are disposable blades. Now it's seven o'clock, when I finish showering and shaving, and I am “on to breakfast,” meaning now I am going to have my breakfast. Let's listen to the story again, this time at a native rate of speech. [Start of story] I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 a.m. My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The toilet is next to that, with the tub in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet. I pour a small amount into a cup, swish it around for 30 seconds, gargle, and spit. Not pleasant, but necessary. Then I get out the floss. When I’m done flossing, I pull out the toothbrush and the toothpaste. I brush and then it’s off to the shower. I pull the shower curtain aside, step into the tub, and pull the curtain back. I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the perfect temperature. I lather up with soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then rinse and dry off. Now it’s shaving time. I used to own an electric razor, but I found it didn’t shave close enough. So now I’m back to the old hand razor. I lather up with shaving cream, and I start to shave. I rinse the razor and throw the disposable blades in the trash. It’s about 7:00 AM, and I’m on to breakfast.

I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development. On our previous episode, we went into the bathroom, shaved, showered, brushed our teeth; now, we are ready to eat breakfast. Let's get started with part three: Eating Breakfast. [Start of story] I walk into my kitchen and turn on the coffeemaker. I always put the coffee, filter, and water in the night before so it’s ready to go. Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored. I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffles, but the truth is that I just don’t have the time to cook. So, I pour myself a bowl of cereal and put in a glass of skim milk, making sure I take a spoon out of the silverware tray. I go outside and pick up my newspaper, and sit down at the kitchen table. I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of the stories. When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of toast with jam. I rinse off my breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the dishwasher. By that time, my coffee is ready so I pour myself a cup and put the rest in a Thermos for work. [End of story] In this episode, we are eating our breakfast. I begin by walking “into my kitchen and” turning “on the coffeemaker.” Notice these verbs, to walk into or to walk in, to turn on. Those two word verbs are very common in English. So, I don't just walk to my kitchen, “I walk into my kitchen and” I “turn on the coffeemaker.” The coffeemaker, “coffeemaker,” (all one word) is the machine that, you can guess, makes the coffee; that's the coffeemaker. Usually, a coffeemaker has water on the top—place where you put the water—and then, it has a place for the actual coffee. Now, you take the coffee and you put it into a piece of paper or a piece of plastic called a filter. The filter, “filter,” is something that allows the water to go through it, but doesn't allow the coffee to go through it. So, you put the coffee into the filter and the hot water goes through the coffee, it goes out of the filter and goes into the coffee pot, “pot,” the coffee pot is on the bottom. So, you have the coffee, the coffee filter, and the coffee pot. After the water goes through the coffee, what you have to throw out—what you have to remove when you are done—are called the coffee grounds, “grounds.” Well, I put in “the coffee, the filter, and the water the night before,” meaning, in this case, last night, “so that it is ready to go,” meaning when I walk into the kitchen, it is already ready, I just have to turn it on. Some coffeemakers have clocks that will automatically turn your coffeemaker on in the morning. “Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored.” The cupboard—cupboard, which looks like the word “cup” and the word “board” put together, but is pronounced cupboard—a cupboard is like a cabinet. It's a place where you store things—a place where you keep things. To store, “store,” as a verb means to keep something in a place—to keep something in a cupboard, or cabinet, or a box. Well, the cupboard is what we call the cabinets that are in the kitchen. They're the like wooden boxes that have doors on them that you can put things in. Usually, if it's a big cupboard, you have different shelves, “shelves,” the singular is shelf, “shelf.” Well, I go into the cupboard and I get the cereal out. The cereal, “cereal,” is a very popular breakfast in the United States. It's usually dry and you put milk in a bowl, with the cereal, and eat the cereal and the milk together. I love cereal in the morning. I really do; I have cereal every morning. Since I was, I think, five years old, I've been eating cereal. I take the cereal out—where it is stored in the cupboard—and I prepare my breakfast. I say in the story that “I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning.” Ham is a type of meat that comes from a pig; it usually has a lot of salt in it. Another kind of meat that's popular in the morning for breakfast is bacon, “bacon,” which is also meat that comes from a pig. It is long and thin usually; it's cut to be long and thin. Eggs are the things that come from chickens—or does the chicken come from the egg? I'm not sure. Anyway, we have ham and eggs, which is a very popular American breakfast. Many people in the United States eat what we would call a very heavy breakfast, meaning there's lots of fat and there's lots of food. In some countries, this is not done, but in the United States it's very common for people to have eggs and ham for breakfast. My father used to have eggs every morning for breakfast before he went to work. Well, I say, “I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffles.” A waffle, “waffle,” is something that is made from batter. Batter, “batter,” when we talk about cooking is a liquid, made usually with eggs, and flower, and perhaps milk, and you combine these things together and you get a thick liquid, which we call batter, and you take the batter and you put it into a special cooking machine, which we call a waffle iron, “iron.” And, a waffle iron has a certain shape, usually it's square, and when you put the batter in, you close the top of it and you cook it from both sides. And, when you take it out, it has little squares in it, and this is called a waffle. It's a kind of almost like a bread. And, after you make the waffle, you usually put some special type of liquid sugar, which we call syrup, “syrup.” Often, this comes from trees; the best syrup comes from maple leaf trees. It's called maple syrup; it's very good. And, you put that thick sugar liquid on top of the waffle. You can also put some sort of fruit on top of the waffle also; I just like the sugar, myself. Something similar to a waffle is a pancake, “pancake,” (all one word), and a pancake is also made from this batter—this liquid—thick liquid—except it goes into a flat pan on your stove and you flip it over. So, it's completely flat, there are no squares in it, usually it's round, and that's called a pancake. Both waffles and pancakes can be in stacks. A stack, “stack,” is when you have one long, thin thing on top of another. So, you can have a stack of paper, pieces of paper one on top of the other. The same is true with a waffle or with pancakes. You can have a stack of waffles, one waffle on top of another, or a stack of pancakes. Usually, we talk about a stack of pancakes. If you go to a restaurant and you order breakfast and you want pancakes, sometimes they will ask you if want a “short stack,” meaning just one or two, or you might have a regular stack, which could be four or five. Remember, Americans eat a big breakfast, that's why there's so many big Americans. Getting back to our story, I am not having ham, eggs or waffles; I'm having a bowl of cereal. And, to prepare my cereal, I put it into a bowl and I pour skim milk on top. Skim, “skim,” milk is milk with no or very little fat in it. Milk comes in four different types: you have whole milk, which has the most fat; you have two percent milk, which has somewhat less fat; you can have one percent, which is even less fat; or you can have fat free, or skim, milk, which has little or no fat at all. Well, because I don't want to be a big American, I have skim milk. In order to eat my cereal, I have to “take a spoon out of the silverware tray.” The silverware, “silverware,” (all one word) is the name we give the knife, the fork, and the spoon together. Sometimes those are called silverware even though they are not made of silver. Other people in a restaurant may call them utensils. Utensils, “utensils.” If you go to a restaurant and you sit down and you don't have a spoon or a fork or a knife, you would ask the waiter or waitress for some utensils, or you could just say, “I need some silverware.” A silverware tray, “tray,” is a place where you put the silverware—you put the utensils, the forks, the spoons, the knives—in a drawer. And, usually a tray is like a little box that has holes in it for specific things. That word, tray, can also be used to describe a small, flat piece of plastic or wood that you use to carry things on, like your dishes. Well, I get my spoon, and I go out and I get my newspaper, which, of course, is what has the news, the sports, and the international and national news. Many Americans like to read a newspaper in the morning, just like people all over the world do. I “sit down at the kitchen table” and I read the paper. Sometimes we call a newspaper just the paper. Someone says, “I read it in the paper this morning,” they mean the newspaper. “Usually I just have time to read” a couple of stories, “a few of the stories. When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of toast with jam.” To grab, “grab,” means to take something, usually with your hand. To grab something with your hand means to pick it up—to take it with your hand. “I grab a banana,” which I like to eat, and “a slice of toast with jam.” Toast, “toast,” is bread that you put in something called a toaster, “toaster,” and the toaster heats up the bread until the bread is brown on the outside. A slice of toast, “slice,” is a piece of toast. We use the words slice when we are talking about one piece of bread, or one piece of cake. You can have a slice of cake; you can also have a slice of pie. This is a slice of toast, which is bread that we put in a toaster, and we toast the bread. We can use toast as a verb as well. And, after I toast the bread, I can put butter on it or I can put jam, “jam.” And, jam is made from fruit—such as strawberries—and sugar, and they put them together and it makes a thick liquid that you can put on a piece of toast. We would say we spread the jam on the toast. We use that verb spread, “spread,” to talk about putting butter or putting jam on a piece of toast, usually with a knife. When I am done with my breakfast, “I rinse off my breakfast dishes.” To rinse means to clean something with water. To rinse off is the verb. You could just say, “I rinse my breakfast dishes,” but we like those two word verbs in English and so we would probably say, “rinse off my breakfast dishes.” I rinse them off in the sink, and I “put them in the dishwasher.” The dishwasher, “dishwasher,” is a machine that cleans the dishes. Some families have dishwashers. The joke that we make sometimes in English is that someone— when someone says, “Oh, do you have a dishwasher,” and you say, “Yes, I am the dishwasher,” which means you don't have a machine that washes your dishes; you wash your dishes by yourself. We would say you wash them by hand. But the time I'm finished rinsing off my breakfast dishes, “my coffee is ready” and “so I pour myself a cup.” Notice the use of that verb, pour. We use that verb when we are removing liquid from a bottle and putting it into a cup or a glass. We also used that verb, pour, when I said, “I pour myself a bowl of cereal.” Now, cereal isn't liquid, but it is something that you can put into another container, in this case, into a bowl, and it comes out of the bigger container and into the smaller container. So, it comes out of the cereal box and goes into the bowl. So, we use that verb usually when we talk about liquid things like water or milk, but you can also use it when we talk about cereal. Well, “I pour myself a cup” of coffee and I “put the rest in a Thermos for work.” A Thermos, which is “Thermos,” is a bottle that keeps hot liquid hot and cold liquid cold. So, if you have hot coffee and you put it into a Thermos, the Thermos—this bottle—will keep it hot for a long time. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regular speed. [Start of story] I walk into my kitchen and turn on the coffeemaker. I always put the coffee, filter, and water in the night before so it’s ready to go. Next, I open the door of the cupboard where the cereal is stored. I would love to have ham and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe a stack of waffles, but the truth is that I just don’t have the time to cook. So, I pour myself a bowl of cereal and put in a glass of skim milk, making sure I take a spoon out of the silverware tray. I go outside and pick up my newspaper, and sit down at the kitchen table. I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of the stories. When I’ve finished my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of toast with jam. I rinse off my breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the dishwasher. By that time, my coffee is ready so I pour myself a cup and put the rest in a Thermos for work.

I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development. Part four of our course is called “Getting Dressed and Ready for Work.” Let's start. [Start of story] I go back into my bedroom and open up my closet door. I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and some sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts. I pull out a clean pair of socks and underwear, and then decide which shirt I’m going to wear today. I’m terrible at color coordinating, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and pants. I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes. I put my cell phone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one. I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag. I used to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers. Now it’s back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos on the way out the door. I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the garage. I’m usually running late and today is no exception! [End of story] Part four is called “Getting Dressed and Ready for Work.” We began by me going into the bedroom and opening up my closet door. To open up means here to open the door. A closet, “closet,” is a place, usually in your bedroom, where you put clothes—you store your clothing. You can also have a closet in other parts of your house, and it's usually a place where you keep things—you store things. Well, I “open up my closet door” and I look at my dress shirts. My dress, “dress” shirts (two words) are the nice shirts, the shirts that I can wear to work. The opposite of a dress shirt would be a casual shirt, “casual.” A dress shirt is a nice shirt; something that usually has a collar on it. A collar, “collar,” is the top of the shirt, what goes around the neck. Well, I look at my dress shirts and I look, also, at my pants, “pants.” Pants are what you put on your legs. You can have different kinds of pants. Jeans is a type of pants. We might say dress pants for nice pants that you would wear to work. I also have ties. A tie, “tie,” is a long, thin thing that goes around your neck that men usually wear—often wear to work, and it comes in different colors, and that's your tie. A sweater, “sweater,” is something that keeps you warm. It's like a shirt that's very thick. You usually put a sweater over your shirt so that you can be warm. Suit jackets, “suit jackets,” (two words) are jackets that you wear that are for a formal occasion. So, if you are going to work, especially if you were going to an interview, you would wear a suit jacket. The word suit, “suit,” refers to a formal set of clothing for, in this case, a man. For a man it would be pants and a, probably, white shirt and a suit jacket that goes over your shirt. Usually, you would also have a tie that you wear. That's a suit. Well, a suit jacket is part of a suit. A t-shirt, spelled “t-shirt,” is a plain shirt that you usually wear underneath a dress shirt. So first, you put on a t-shirt—a white t-shirt—then you would put on your shirt, and then you would put on you jacket. T-shirts can also be used by themselves as your main shirt. It is usually an informal occasion that you would just wear a t-shirt. You probably wouldn't wear a t-shirt to your office, for example, though some people do. And, many people have t-shirts that have things on them—that say things on them. T-shirts usually do not have a collar like a dress shirt does. “I pull out a pair of socks and underwear.” Socks, “socks” are the things you put on your feet before you put your shoe on. Socks can be dark, or they can be light or white socks. Normally you don't wear white socks with a formal suit; you would wear black or dark blue socks. Underwear is the piece of clothing that you put on and it covers up all of the— how should we say—things that you want to cover so that you can keep your pants and shirt clean. Underwear is something that goes over your back of your body, your butt or your rear, as well as the front of the body, whatever you have there. Underwear can come for men in two basics styles usually. There can be boxer underwear, or boxer shorts, “boxer,” and that's a kind of short—or rather, a kind of underwear that it is loose on the bottom. So, it's almost like a pair of shorts. The opposite of that would be briefs, “briefs.” Briefs would be underwear that is not loose at the bottom; it's tight at the bottom of the underwear. Usually it's a little smaller as well. I “then decide which shirt I'm going to wear today. I'm terrible,” I say, “at color coordinating.” Color coordinating means you wear things that have similar or matching colors. So, if you wore a pink shirt you would probably not wear green pants because they don't do together, we would say; they don't look very good with each other. Color coordinating is finding the right colors that you wear on your—with your shirt, and your pants, and your tie, and your jacket, and your socks, and your shoes. All of those have to be color coordinated. The verb to coordinate, “coordinate,” means to put two things together so that they work well together, in this case. Well, since I'm so terrible—I'm so bad—at color coordinating I usually bring in my wife, that is I go and ask my wife to come into the room. So, I “bring my wife in”—to the room—”at this point to help” me, meaning at this time, when I've already picked out some things, then I bring my wife to help me “match my shirt and pants.” I want them color coordinate. “I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes.” A belt, “belt,” is what you use to keep your pants from falling down. A buckle is the piece of, usually, metal in the front that connects the belt so it forms a circle around your body. I have a silver buckle that I put on with my belt. I also “polish my shoes.” To polish, “polish,” means to clean and to make shiny, “shiny.” When we say something is shiny, we mean that it's bright—it reflects light. So, when you polish your shoes, you want them to be clean but you also want them to look like they are bright—they are reflecting light. I polish my shoes and my head, so it's very shiny! “I put my cell phone,” my cellular or mobile phone, “and car keys in my front pocket.” You have front pockets and you have back pockets in a pair of pants. So, I put my keys and cell phone in the front pocket “and my wallet in the back” pocket. My wallet, “wallet,” is where I put my money and my credit cards and my driver's license; all of those things go in my wallet. “I put on my glasses,” because I cannot see without my glasses very well, and I “check myself in the mirror.” To check yourself means to look at yourself, usually in a mirror, and you can see how you look. I usually look pretty ugly. I “check myself in the mirror, and then” I “go into” my “home office,” or my office in my house and “get my bag. I used to carry a more traditional briefcase.” A briefcase, “briefcase,” (all one word) is not something that you put your underwear in—your briefs. A briefcase means the thing that you carry papers in when you are going from your home to your office. Usually a briefcase is square and it usually has hard sides on it, many times it has a lock on the top; that's a briefcase. A lot of people nowadays do not use a briefcase; they use a computer bag—a bag that they can put their computer and other information in, including their papers. Well, I put my things into my computer bag, then I go “back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos,” to get or take my Thermos with my coffee in it “on the way out the door.” The expression, on the way out, means that you are about to leave or you are leaving your house, in this case. Some money may call you on the phone and you are getting ready to go to dinner, you could say, “I can't talk right now, I'm on my way out the door,” means I'm just getting ready to leave. Well, before I leave—before I'm going out the door—I “grab my Thermos. I lock the door,” to my house, “and then I hurry to my car in the garage.” The garage, “garage,” is the place where you keep your car. “I'm usually running late and today is no exception!” When you are running late, you are behind your schedule; you're behind time that you want to be somewhere. To run late means the same as to be late or to be tardy, “tardy.” Usually that word, tardy, is only used in school. We say a student is tardy, we mean that they are late for school or late for class. To be running late means that you are not on the schedule that you want to be on—that you did not leave at the time you wanted to leave. I say I'm “running late and today is no exception!” That expression, is no exception, “exception,” means that today is the same as every other day—it is not different. An exception is when something is different. Well, today is no different, that means today is no exception—it is not different. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a normal speed. [Start of story] I go back into my bedroom and open up my closet door. I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and some sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts. I pull out a clean pair of socks and underwear, then decide which shirt I’m going to wear today. I’m terrible at color coordinating, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and pants. I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes. I put my cell phone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one. I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag. I used to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers. Now it’s back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos on the way out the door. I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the garage. I’m usually running late and today is no exception!

I'm Dr. Jeff McQuillan, your host. This part of our course is going to talk about going to work and vocabulary related to commuting. Let's get started. [Start of story] I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the back seat, and get comfortable for my drive. I put my coffee mug into the cup holder, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal, and start the car. My wife drove the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirrors. I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report. I take the transmission out of park and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street, close the garage door, and put the car into drive. I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more. I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off. My office is only a few miles from the exit. I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in. I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator. And that only took 40 minutes! [End of story] Part five is called “The Commute to Work.” Commute, “commute,” can be both a noun and a verb. It means to go from your house to your work. Usually, if you live a long distance from your work, you would say, “I have a long commute.” Or, if you live close to work, you would have a short commute. If it's a very long commute with lots of traffic, you might say, “I have a terrible commute” - a very bad commute. The story begins by me saying that “I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the back seat.” So, I open my front door - the door that we would call the driver's side, where the driver gets in, and in an American car, that is on the left side. Cars in Britain are on the right side, is the driver's side. So, I get into the left side in the front door. If you have a car that has a back seat, you could have a two-door car or a four-door car. Four doors means that you have separate doors for the back seat. The seat, “seat,” is what you sit in. So, the back seat is where people can sit behind you - behind the driver and behind the person next to the driver. We call the seats the passenger seats and the driver's seat. The right side of the car is usually called the passenger side of the car. I “get comfortable for my drive” - for my commute - notice we use drive there as a noun; it can be a verb and a noun. “I put my coffee mug into the cup holder.” A mug, “mug,” is just a big cup. We talk about coffee mugs, they're big cups that you put your coffee into. In many cars, there is a special place for a cup or a bottle, and that's called a cup holder, “holder.” It holds the cup so you can have your coffee in your car. I “put the keys in the ignition.” The keys are, of course, what starts your car. It's the piece of metal that you open your car door with - you unlock it. Well, you also start the car with your keys, and you put them into something called the ignition. And, the ignition, “ignition,” is the part of the car that starts the engine. Usually it makes a certain sound - a certain noise, and once the engine starts, then you don't have to put the key forward, you just leave the key there, you take your hand off of it. The word ignition comes from the verb to ignite, “ignite,” which means to start a fire - to start something burning, and of course, a car burns gasoline, that's what the engine does in order to make the car move. After I put the keys into the ignition, I “find the gas pedal.” A pedal, “pedal,” is something you use to control with your feet usually the speed of something. So the gas pedal is the pedal that you press down to go faster, it gives the engine more gas. That word, pedal, can also be used as a verb. If you are on a bicycle, in order to make the bicycle move, you have to pedal because the things that your feet are on on a bike, or a bicycle, are called pedals. Well, you don't pedal your car, but you do have a gas pedal. I “start the car,” and because “My wife drove the car last night, I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror.” To re-adjust means to adjust again. That prefix re, means again in English, usually. To adjust means to-to move them so that I can see properly - I can see into the mirror. There are two types of mirrors on your car: there's the rear, “rear,” view, “view,” mirror, and that is in the front of the car, on the front window of the car. The front window of your car is called your windshield, “windshield,” the windshield. So, on your windshield, on the top in the middle, is your rear view mirror, and that allows you to see cars behind you. There are also mirrors on the side of the car, usually on both sides, and those are called the side mirrors. “I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report.” Drive time is the time of day when most people are either going to work or coming back from work. So, in the morning the drive time in Los Angeles, for example, is 7:30 to 9:30. Most people are going to work during those hours. In other cities it could be different; in some cities, it's earlier than that. There's also a drive time at the end of the day, between 5:00 and 7:00 here in Los Angeles, that's when people are coming home from work. So, the drive time traffic report is an announcement on the radio telling you if there are any accidents on the roads, if there is any construction - that is the government is fixing the road and it may be closed. And, it tells you if you are going to take a long time or not a long time. So, traffic reports tell you how fast the cars are moving on different, usually, freeways in American cities. “I take the transmission out of park and into reverse.” The transmission, “transmission,” is the part of the car that determines how fast you go. It also determines if you go forward or backwards - if you're going straight ahead or behind; that's the transmission. Sometimes it's called a transmission box, “box,” and inside of that box there are little wheels called gears, “gears,” and depending on the gear you are in, we would say, depending on the gear you are using, you will either go very fast or not very fast, or you will go in reverse, “reverse.” To go into reverse means to go backwards - the car moves backwards. Well, before I go anywhere, I have to “take the transmission out of park,” “park.” Park is when the car is not going forward or going backwards. We say you put the transmission into park, and you take it out of park. And when you take it out of park, you either go forward or backwards. Well, here I'm going in reverse, and I “back out into the driveway.” To back out means to go backwards. Usually that verb, to back out, is used when you are talking about a car or a truck that is leaving a garage, and it's going in reverse - you back out of the garage. I “back out into the driveway” onto the street, or “into the street.” The driveway, “driveway,” is what connects the garage to the street. It's the space that is in between your street and where your car is parked, your garage. Some people actually don't have a garage, and so they park in their driveway. They drive off the street and they park their car in the driveway, that piece of land where you can put your car. I like to park my car on my neighbor's driveway so I have more room on my driveway. He doesn't like it though. So, I back out of the garage, and then I “close the garage door, and put the car into drive.” Here's another use of that word, drive. In this case, it means I'm putting it in a gear that will take me forward. So, to put a car into drive means that you change the position of the transmission so that your car will go forward and not backwards. “I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.” There are two kinds of transmissions - two kinds of cars. One is what we call an automatic transmission, where you put your car either into reverse or into drive, and that's it. You don't have to change anything. Another kind of car is called a stick shift, or a manual transmission. Manual, “manual,” is the opposite of automatic; it means by hand. So, if you have a manual transmission, or a stick shift, you have to move the transmission each time you want to go faster or slower. The word stick, “stick,” shift, “shift,” (two words) is the same as a manual transmission. Some people say, “I drive a stick,” they mean, “I drive a stick shift.” The word shift is also a verb, to shift, and that means to change. So, if you have a manual transmission - a stick shift - you shift from one gear to another. If you want to go faster, you have to shift into a higher gear. Well, if you don't have a manual transmission, you don't have to worry about it. If you have a stick shift, you have an extra pedal in the car. Remember, we said that a pedal can be a gas pedal - something that makes you go faster. You also have a brake pedal that will slow or stop your car. And, if you have a stick shift, you have a third pedal, which we call the clutch, “clutch.” And, in order to change from one gear to another, to go faster or slower or to go into reverse, if you have a stick shift, you have press on or put your foot on the clutch so that you can change, or shift, gears. “I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway.” The onramp, “onramp,” is what connects the street to the freeway. So, just like a driveway connects the street to your garage, an onramp connects the street to the freeway. The opposite of an onramp would be, of course, an off ramp, and that's where you go off of the freeway and back to the street. Well, I get onto the onramp, or “I get on the onramp and I drive to where I have to get off. My office is only a few miles from the exit.” The exit, “exit,” is where you leave the freeway. It can be a noun or it can be a verb. To exit means to leave, and normally, in a public building, a hotel or other areas, they have a sign that says, “exit,” so you know in case there is an emergency how to leave the room or leave the building. On an airplane, we have something called the emergency exits, and those are doors that you use if the plane is having problems. I hope you never have to use the emergency exits. Well, this is an exit from the freeway, and “my office is only a few miles” after I get off of the freeway. “I pull into the parking garage,” the place at my work where you park or keep your car, and I swipe my key card to get in. A key card, “key card,” (two words) is like a credit card. It's an electronic card that the company gives you that allows you to get in and out of a garage, in and out of the building, maybe even in and out of your office, and it's an electronic card, like a credit card. To swipe is the verb we use when we talk about credit cards or key cards. To swipe, “swipe,” means to take the card and put it into what we would call a reader very quickly. So, for a credit card, the clerk will swipe the card - will put it through the machine very quickly. For a key card, you put it through the machine so you can get into somewhere. It's a key - an electronic key. I “park my car,” I “grab my briefcase and my coffee” - very important, my coffee - and I “head toward the elevator.” To head toward something means to walk in that direction or move in that direction. So, I walk toward the elevator, and my whole trip “only took 40 minutes.” Americans love to complain about how terrible their commutes are. In some cities, 30 or 40 minutes is considered a long commute, and in some cities, like Los Angeles, it's considered an average commute. In other countries, some people commute an hour or an hour and a half in order to get to their work. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regular speed. [Start of story] I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the back seat, and get comfortable for my drive. I put my coffee mug into the cup holder, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal, and start the car. My wife drove the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirrors. I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report. I take the transmission out of park and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street, close the garage door, and put the car into drive.

I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development. In episode five of our course, we commuted to work - we drove to work. Now, we are at work and we're going to go on break and go to lunch. Let's get started. [Start of story] On the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today. When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox. When I turn on my computer, I see at least two-dozen emails I need to go through. Just as I start in on the email, my phone rings. It’s my project manager, Julie, asking me to come in for a conference call with our head office. I don’t get back to my desk for nearly two hours. By that time, I was ready for a break. At 10:30, I head down to the break room and get some hot water at the water cooler to make some tea. There were a couple of other people on break, having snacks out of the vending machine and reading the new notices on the bulletin board. I run into Sam, one of my friends at work, and we chat a little before going back to work. Before long, it’s time for lunch. I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk. If I don’t have time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out. The only trouble is, it’s always so busy during the lunch hour and I always have to stand in line. That’s usually a pain. On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch with a few friends from work. On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy. [End of Story] Part six is called “At my Desk, on Break, and at Lunch.” Notice the use of those prepositions. Prepositions are very difficult to translate and many people get confused when you start learning another language trying to figure out those little words - which word should you use. There's a difference between “at my desk” and “on my desk” and “in my desk.” Those all mean different things. “On your desk” means something is on top of your desk, like your computer. “In your desk” means something is inside one of the drawers of your desks. “At your desk” means that you are sitting next to your desk - you are, we hope, working, like you're supposed to be working right now, instead of listening to this episode. “On break” is the expression we use when you are stopping work for a short time, usually ten, 15, maybe 20 minutes. “At lunch” means that you are going to lunch - you are eating. We don't say, “in lunch” or “on lunch,” we say, “at lunch.” The best way to learn those little prepositions is just to read and to listen more and more, and eventually, you will know them without even having to study them. Our story begins by me saying that, “On the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today.” Your agenda, “agenda,” means your plan for today - what are the things that you have to do today. This could include meetings; it could include phone calls; you could have many different things on your agenda. There's another expression, “to have an agenda.” To have an agenda means that you have a plan, sometimes a secret plan that you don't tell anyone about that makes you want to do a certain thing. It's like having an opinion and trying to get other people to do what you want them to do; that's to have an agenda. But here, agenda just means a list of things that you're going to do. “When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox.” Stack, you'll remember, is when you have thin things on top of each other. You can have a stack of pancakes; here we have a stack of papers and memos. A memo, “memo,” is short for memorandum, and it is usually like a letter that you send to someone in your company - in your office. Your inbox, “inbox,” can be a little box on your desk where people put things for you to do, your boss, for example. And, when you are done with them, you can put them in your out box. Those terms, inbox and out box, are also used for email programs now. “When I turn on my computer, I” have “at least two-dozen emails I need to go through.” The expression, to go through, here means I have to read them and maybe respond to them. Someone may say, “I have to go through my email,” they mean I have to read my email, and I have to respond, sometimes, to my email. I have to do that everyday, just like you do, but most of my emails come from you. “Just as I start in on the email, my phone rings.” The expression “to start in on” something means to begin to do something. So, I start in on my phone calls, that means that I have many phone calls and I start making them - I begin making them. There's a different expression, to start in on someone - on a person, and if you start in on a person - on your brother, on your wife - that means that you are criticizing them - you're saying something bad - something negative about them. When I was younger, if I didn't do my homework, which was often, my mother would start in on me, meaning she would criticize me. “Jeffrey, do your homework!” The only person who calls me “Jeffrey” is my mother. Back to our story, I said that my phone rang and it was “my project manager, Julie.” The manager is the person that is in charge of a certain group of people - someone who is the boss - and a project is just a set of things for you to do, usually related to each other. Well, my project manager, who's like my boss, “asked me to come in for a conference call with our head office.” A conference, “conference,” call is a telephone call with three or more people. And, that's very common in American business and in international business to have a conference call so more than one person can talk on the telephone. The head office, “head,” is the same as the main office, and this is where the company has most of its important people who are working, it's sometimes called its headquarters. The head office is the main office. The opposite of head office would be a branch office, “branch.” A branch office is a smaller office. We were having a conference call with someone in our head office, and I didn't “get back to my desk” - I didn't return to my desk - for almost, or “nearly two hours. By that time, I was ready for a break. At 10:30, I head down to the break room.” The break room, “break” room (two words) is a place in a building - in your office, where people can go and read and relax, perhaps eat their lunch, or eat some food, It's a place for you to stop work and to relax a little or to talk to other people. I use the verb to head down, that simply means to go to somewhere. We sometimes use that expression when we are talking about going to a different place. “I'm going to head down to the boss's office” - I'm going to go over to the boss's office. Well, “I head down to the break room” - I go to the break room - “and get some hot water” from “the water cooler.” The water cooler, “cooler,” is a little machine that has water and you can get hot water or you can get cold water. That expression, the water cooler, is very common. When people say, “I heard it at the water cooler,” or “around the water cooler,” that usually refers to people who are gossiping - who are talking about things they probably shouldn't. Well, I went to the water and I made myself some tea, because I love drinking tea. There are “a couple of other people on break,” notice that we use that expression “on break” - people who have stopped working - “having snacks out of the vending machine.” A snack, “snack,” is a piece of food that you eat between breakfast and lunch, or between lunch and dinner, or between dinner and going to bed. A vending machine, “vending,” is a big machine where you can buy, usually, food. The verb, to vend, “vend,” means to sell. So, it's a place where you can sell food and you put your money in and you can press a button and you get things like cookies and potato chips, all the things that are not good for you in the vending machine. Some people are also “reading the new notices on the bulletin board.” The bulletin board, “bulletin,” board (two words) is a big piece of usually wood or plastic where people put important messages for other people to read. You can have a bulletin board at your work; you can have a bulletin board in a school, and usually, it's a place where different people can come and read the news or new things or new announcements. “I run into Sam, one of my friends at work.” The verb, to run into, means I meet him although I was not expecting to meet him. So, “I run into Sam, and we chat a little before going back to work.” To chat, “chat,” means to talk, usually about something not very important. “Before long, it’s time for lunch,” meaning after a short time, it's time for lunch. Before long means a short time or after a short time. “I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk.” Notice that use of “at my desk,” means I'm sitting by my desk and I'm eating my lunch. Sounds kind of lonely. “If I don’t have time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out.” To pack, “pack,” a lunch means to make your lunch at home - a sandwich, for example - and put that into a bag or a box that you take with you to work; that is to pack a lunch. If I don't pack a lunch, I usually eat take-out, “take- out.” Take-out is when you go to a restaurant but you don't eat at the restaurant - you don't dine in, we would say, “dine” in, you don't dine in, you do take-out. You could also have the restaurant deliver the food - bring the food to your house, or bring the food to your office, and we would call that delivery. So, you can dine in; you can do take-out, meaning you go to the restaurant, or you can have delivery - someone brings the food to you. “The only trouble is,” I say, “it’s always so busy during the lunch hour.” The lunch hour, in most American companies, is from noon to one or 1:30, or 11:30 in the morning to maybe one o'clock in the afternoon. It's usually longer than an hour, though in some companies, you only get one hour. Some companies, you only get 30 minutes to eat. “I always have to stand in line” because it's so busy. To stand in line means to wait behind other people. In England, they would say to queue; in the US we say to stand in line. I say, “That’s usually a pain.” When we say something is a pain, “pain,” we mean that it's very inconvenient or uncomfortable - something you do not like. People will also say a pain in the neck or a pain in the butt, “butt.” Those are the same basic meanings. Something that's a pain in the neck or a pain in the butt means it's not something that you like, it's very inconvenient. “On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch” - I go to eat somewhere else - “with a few friends from work. On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.” Casual, “casual,” is the same as informal. In many companies in the United States, they have casual Friday, and that's a day where you do not have to wear as nice of clothing. Maybe you'll wear a t-shirt and not a suit jacket, or you don't have to wear a tie, and it's also a day where people feel a little more relaxed. Usually it has to do with what you can wear to work. Well, in the story I say that “On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.” To kick back, “kick back,” (two words) means to relax. It's an informal expression that means that you are relaxing, and take it easy also means relax. Kick back is a little more informal; it's something that you might do, for example, with your friends. And, if you drink alcohol, you might have some alcohol and relax; that's to kick back. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a normal speed. [Start of story] On the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today. When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox. When I turn on my computer, I see at least two-dozen emails I need to go through. Just as I start in on the email, my phone rings. It’s my project manager, Julie, asking me to come in for a conference call with our head office. I don’t get back to my desk for nearly two hours. By that time, I was ready for a break. At 10:30, I head down to the break room and get some hot water at the water cooler to make some tea. There were a couple of other people on break, having snacks out of the vending machine and reading the new notices on the bulletin board. I run into Sam, one of my friends at work, and we chat a little before going back to work. Before long, it’s time for lunch. I usually bring my lunch with me to work and eat it at my desk. If I don’t have time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some take-out. The only trouble is, it’s always so busy during the lunch hour and I always have to stand in line. That’s usually a pain. On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch with a few friends from work. On casual Fridays, we can kick back a little and take it easy.

I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development. In part six, we were at work, we took a break, and we went to lunch. Now, our work is finished and we get to go home. Let's get started. [Start of story] It’s five o’clock and it’s quitting time. I put a few files into my bag, grab my mug, and say goodnight to the rest of the people in my area. I go to the parking garage and get into my car. I signal my turn onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp. I merge as best as I can onto the freeway, which is always a bit of a hassle at this hour. Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from downtown. I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in fast lane near La Brea, backing up traffic all the way to Hoover. I decide to get off the freeway and to take surface streets for the rest of the trip. I need to make a stop on the way home. I know that the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market. I get there and I pick up some French bread, a bag of apples, a few bananas, some pasta, tomato sauce, and a cooked chicken. Luckily, they have a lot of checkout stands open, and I get through the line pretty quickly. I thank the cashier and the bagger and push my cart to my car. I open the trunk and load everything up. Just then my wife calls me on my cell phone. She was going to be a little late getting home and asks me to make something for dinner. Tonight, I will be the cook. [End of story] This episode is called “The Commute Home and Running Errands.” Commute, you know, means driving back and forth from your house to your work. To run an errand, “errand,” means to do something, usually something outside of your house. For example, going to the grocery store, going to the drug store, stopping by the post office to mail a letter, these are things that you have to do that are not part of your work but that you need to do in your daily life. And, we call these things errands, and the verb is to run an errand. Our story says, “It's five o'clock and it's quitting time.” Quitting time is the time that you stop working. To quit, “quit,” means to stop, so quitting time is the time that you stop working at the end of the day. “I put a few files into my bag,” I “grab my mug,” - my coffee mug - and I “say goodnight to the rest of the people in my area.” If you work at a big company, usually you are divided into smaller groups that work on the same topic - the same type of work. So, there is an accounting section and there is a sales section. One way to describe those smaller groups is an area, so people in your area would be people who work next to you on the same things that you do. “I go to the parking garage and get into my car. I signal my turn onto the street.” To signal, “signal,” means to indicate, and in a car it means to turn on what we call the blinker, “blinker.” The blinker is what indicates whether you are going to turn left or right. So, when you are driving your car and you want to make a turn, you have to signal, are you going left or are you going right. And of course, in the back of the car, there's a little light that goes on and off, we would say it flashes, “flashes.” To flash means to go on and off quickly. So, “I signal my turn” - left or right - “onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp. I merge as best as I can onto the freeway.” To merge on the freeway or to merge when you are driving means that there are two lanes - two cars next to each other - but the road is getting more narrow. The road becomes smaller and now you only have one lane, so these two lines of cars have to go into the same lane, and we call that merging. To merge, “merge,” as a verb means to take two things and to put them together. We talk about companies that merge; one company buys another company and they merge - they come together. Well, in traffic when you are driving, to merge means to go from two lanes to one lane, and you have to go into and combine with another lane of traffic. “I merge as best as I can, which is always a bit of a hassle at this hour.” A hassle, “hassle,” is the same as a problem. So, it “is always a bit of,” meaning a little bit - somewhat of a problem “at this hour. Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from downtown.” We use that word traffic, “traffic,” to mean the cars on the street or the cars on the freeway. You may ask someone, “How was traffic,” and they may say, “Oh, it was terrible. Traffic was really bad on the freeway this afternoon.” So, it refers to the number of cars and how easy it is to move on the freeway or the street. When we say traffic is stop-and-go we mean that cars are stopping then they go forward maybe ten feet, 20 feet, then they stop again. When there are too many cars on the freeway or on a road, you cannot just drive straight through, you have to stop, wait for the other car and then go, so stop- and-go traffic means that the traffic is moving very slowly. “I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in the fast lane near La Brea.” I'm listening to the radio - to the drive time traffic report, and they tell me that there is a stalled car. To stall, “stall,” means here to stop - to stop working. It doesn't mean that the car will never run again - will never work again. Usually, when we use the verb stall, we mean that it is stopped for a temporary time because it has some problem. So, a stalled car is a car that has stopped working, and if you are on the freeway and your car stalls, you will, of course, cause a problem for the other drivers. Normally, you try to get your car onto the shoulder. The shoulder is the part of the freeway where you can stop your car and not get in the way of anyone else. It's on the right hand side or the left hand side; you can have a shoulder on either side of the freeway. The car that is stalled is in the fast lane. The fast lane on an American freeway or highway is the first lane on the left, what we would say the far left lane if there are more than three lanes or more than two lanes on the freeway. Here in Southern California we have freeways that have six or seven lanes, so if you want to go fast, normally you go to the lane that is in the far left - the first lane on the left; that's the fast lane. Not everyone drives fast in the fast lane, but it's the common understanding among drivers that if you are in the fast lane, you should go faster than the other cars. Well, this car is “stalled in the fast lane near La Brea.” La Brea is a name of a street here in Los Angeles, and the car is “backing up traffic all the way to Hoover.” Hoover is another street here in LA. To back up traffic means that the cars are stopped behind you. When we say there is a backup on the freeway, we mean that the cars are moving very slowly or they're stopped, usually because there's an accident, there's construction - they're fixing the freeway and they have one of the lanes closed, or, in our story, it's because a stalled car is in the fast lane. So, the traffic is moving very slowly, it is backed up “all the way to Hoover,” meaning that beginning at Hoover Street, the cars are stopped or are going very slowly, and all the way to La Brea. “I decide to get off the freeway and to take surface streets for the rest of the trip.” Surface, “surface,” means the top of something, but when we say surface streets, we mean the roads and streets that are not the freeway or the highway. So, the regular roads and streets we would call the surface streets. “I need to make a stop on the way home,” I need to go somewhere before I go home. “I know that the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market.” Fridge, “fridge,” is another way of saying refrigerator - it's a short way of saying refrigerator. The fridge is where you put food to keep it cold. So, my fridge is empty which means I don't have any food, so I decide to go to the market. The market here means the supermarket, a place where you can buy food, or it could be a smaller market, what we might call a corner market; that would be a small store. Often, they are located at the intersection - at the corner of two streets. I get to the market and I pick up some food. “I pick up some French bread,” which is a type of bread, I pick up “a bag of apples,” I get” a few bananas, some pasta,” because I love pasta, some “tomato sauce,” for my pasta, “and a cooked chicken.” In many American supermarkets, you can buy a small chicken that is already cooked for you, so you can just take it home and eat it. If you are lazy, like me, this is a very good way to get some good food, and it is not very expensive. I think it's about maybe six or seven dollars for a cooked chicken. I like to take the chicken and put it into the pasta and tomato sauce and mix them all together. “Luckily,” the supermarket has “a lot of checkout stands open.” A checkout stand is the place where you pay for your food. The verb, to checkout, “checkout,” means to leave and to pay. We use that verb when we are talking about the supermarket. We also use it when we are talking about a hotel. “I'm going to checkout of the hotel,” that means I'm going to leave the hotel and, I hope, pay. A stand, “stand,” here just means the place where you pay for something. Well, “I get through the” checkout “line pretty quickly” - very quickly. “I thank the cashier,” “cashier” - the cashier is the person who takes my money - “and the bagger,” “bagger” - this is the person who puts your groceries into a bag. In some stores they do not have baggers; you have to bag your groceries yourself. Notice we use the word bag, “bag,” as a verb, meaning to put things into a bag. In American grocery stores you can have either a paper bag or a plastic bag. Well, the bagger puts my food into my cart, and I “push my cart to my car.” My cart, “cart,” sometimes called a shopping cart, is what you use to move or to take your food to your car - what you put your food into when you are shopping. It's a little like a big box - metal box with wheels on it. So, it helps you move things, you don't have to carry them yourself. “I open the trunk and load everything up.” To load up means to put things into, in this case, your car. So, if someone says, “I'm going to load up my car,” “load” up, they mean they're going to put the things that they need to put into their car. We often use that verb when we are talking about moving something in your car, or going on a trip. “Just then my wife calls me on my cell phone. She was going to be a little late” this evening. She says she is not going to get home at her normal time, and so she “asks me to make something for dinner.” This is not a good idea since I am not a good cook, but I, of course, say yes. “Tonight, I will be the cook” - the person making the food. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regular speed. [Start of story] It’s five o’clock and it’s quitting time. I put a few files into my bag, grab my mug, and say goodnight to the rest of the people in my area. I go to the parking garage and get into my car. I signal my turn onto the street and drive toward the freeway onramp. I merge as best as I can onto the freeway, which is always a bit of a hassle at this hour. Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from downtown. I hear on the radio that there’s a stalled car in fast lane near La Brea, backing up traffic all the way to Hoover. I decide to get off the freeway and to take surface streets for the rest of the trip. I need to make a stop on the way home. I know that the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market. I get there and I pick up some French bread, a bag of apples, a few bananas, some pasta, tomato sauce, and a cooked chicken. Luckily, they have a lot of checkout stands open, and I get through the line pretty quickly. I thank the cashier and the bagger and push my cart to my car. I open the trunk and load everything up. Just then my wife calls me on my cell phone. She was going to be a little late getting home and asks me to make something for dinner. Tonight, I will be the cook.

In this part, I'm going to make dinner, which should be very interesting since I am a terrible cook. Let's get started. [Start of story] When I get home, I start on dinner right away. I clean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries and decide to make pasta. I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home. I put some water in a pan and turn the burner on high. When the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad. Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!” She comes into the kitchen, and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce. She stirs the sauce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad. I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table. I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us. About 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about our long day. My wife says she’ll do the dishes, since I cooked, but of course I help out by drying them. First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container and some in plastic wrap and the rest in aluminum foil. Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses, and silverware. [End of story] In this episode, we are making dinner at the beginning, “When I get home, I start on dinner right away.” Once again, we have one of those two word verbs in English, “I start on dinner,” that means I begin to prepare dinner. So, “I start on dinner right away. I clean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries.” The kitchen counter, “counter,” is the place in your kitchen where you have a long, flat top or board where you can prepare food and you can put things on, it's like the table almost. But usually in a kitchen, you have cabinets or cupboards, where you store things, and on top you have a counter. A counter is a general word that refers to the top of something, usually somewhere where you do something on top of it. In this case, the kitchen counter is where you prepare food. Well, “I clean off the kitchen counter after” I put “away the groceries.” The groceries, “groceries,” (plural) are the food that I buy at the market. We sometimes call a supermarket a grocery store - a place that you buy groceries - buy food that you bring home and prepare and eat at home. I decided “to make pasta.” So, “I preheat the oven to 375.” To preheat, “preheat,” really means the same here as to heat, but if you look at the instructions for making food, what we would call the recipe, “recipe,” the recipe for making food, usually it begins, if you are going to cooking something in the oven, by telling you to preheat the oven. That just means to turn it on so that when you are ready, when it is hot, you can put the food in to cook. Pre, “pre,” means before or to do something before. So, “I preheat the oven to 375,” in other words, 375 degrees Fahrenheit. I preheat it because I want “to bake the bread and keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home.” To bake, “bake,” is to cook something, usually in an oven. So, I open the oven door, I put in the bread, I put in the chicken, and then I close the door. My wife is going to be home late so I want to keep the chicken hot - I want to make sure that it stays hot. “I put some water in a pan,” a pan is what you use to cook something in. So, “I put some water in a pan and I turn the burner on high.” The burner, “burner,” is on top of what we would call your stove, “stove.” Your burners are for cooking food, where you have the heat comes from the bottom and you put the pan on top of the heat. So, if you are going to boil some water - make the water hot - you would put it in a pan and then put it on top of a burner, and the burner is part of your stove. Usually, stoves and ovens are one machine, one - in one single piece in many American kitchens. In my kitchen, the stove is on top of the oven. I'm going to boil some water. To boil, “boil,” means to make the one of very hot until you start to see bubbles. The average temperature is 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or 100 degrees Celsius, in order to boil water. Well, “when the water starts boiling” - when it starts to make bubbles because it is very hot - “I put in the pasta.” I take the pasta - the pasta noodles, “noodles” - the little pieces of pasta, we call those noodles - and I put them into the boiling water so they can cook. Then I decide I want “to make a salad” because I'm very hungry. Well, just as I decide to make the salad, “just then, my wife opens the back door.” “Just then” - that expression means at that time - at that same time - “my wife opens the back door” - the door to the house in the back, the opposite would be the front door. She yells, “I'm home!” That's what you would say when you come home to someone who is already there, you would say, “I'm home!” You wouldn't say, “I've arrived,” or “I'm here,” you would say, “I'm home.” My wife “comes into the kitchen and helps” me chop the tomatoes. To chop, “chop,” means to cut something into small pieces. We chop tomatoes - we make them into smaller pieces - and we add them to the pasta sauce that's the red liquid that we're going to put over the pasta. My wife “stirs the sauce until it’s done.” To stir, “stir,” when you are cooking means to take a spoon and put it into the pan and move the spoon back and forth so that you are mixing what is in the pan. So, my wife is stirring the sauce - the pasta sauce - the tomato sauce “until it's done” - until it is ready - until it is cooked, “while I finish tossing the salad.” So, she is stirring the sauce and at the same time, I am finishing the salad, and I finished by tossing it. To toss, “toss,” a salad means to mix the salad together. In a salad, you often have lettuce and maybe tomatoes, other food, other vegetables, and you want to mix them together. Often you put in a salad dressing, “dressing.” Salad dressing is a liquid, often made from some oil, that gives a better taste to your salad. So, you toss the salad in order to mix everything up. That verb, to toss, can also mean to throw, usually to throw something to someone else. Someone may say, “toss me that pen,” they mean throw me that pen. Well, I am “tossing the salad” here - mixing it up, “I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table.” The place, “place,” mats, “mats,” are things that you put underneath the plate and the spoon, fork, and knife so that the table doesn't get dirty; we call those place mats. They can be plastic; they can be made out of cloth, and they are used to protect your table. So, “I get out the place mats and the napkins to set the table.” A napkin, “napkin,” is like a little towel that you use. In case you need to wipe your face while you are eating, you can use your napkin, and it's common in American restaurants and in houses for people to put the napkin on their legs while they are sitting - on the top of their legs, which we would call the lap - on your lap, “lap,” you put the napkin while you are eating. To set, “set,” the table means to put all of the things that you need on the table - plates, spoons, knives, forks, and so forth. That is to set the table - to make the table ready so you can eat. “About 15 minutes” after I set the table, my wife and I sit at the table - “we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about our long day.” The dining room, “dining,” is a place where you eat. To dine, as a verb, “dine,” means to eat. So, the dining room is the room in your house where you eat your meals. My wife and I “talk about our long day,” meaning we had many things happen today, and maybe we are very tired, so we had a long day. “My wife says that she’ll do the dishes.” To do the dishes means the same as to wash the dishes. My wife offers to “do the dishes” because “I cooked, but of course,” since I am a wonderful husband, “I help out by drying” the dishes. To help out means the same here as to help. But if we are talking about helping another person do something, maybe something that we don't have to do, but we want to be nice, we would say we help them out. So, I helped my wife out by drying the dishes. “First,' I have to “put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container.” Leftovers, “leftovers,” (all one word) is extra food - food that you did not eat. At the end of your dinner - at the end of your meal - if you want to keep some of that food, we call it leftovers. And in this case, I'm going to put the leftovers into a small plastic box that has a top on it. We call that kind of little box a container, “container.” We usually refer to these plastic boxes that we put food in as Tupperware containers. Tupperware, “Tupperware,” is actually a company that makes these small plastic containers for food. Even if you don't have a container made by that company, many people just call it “my Tupperware” - the Tupperware containers, that means the plastic boxes that you can put food into. Well, some of the food, I put in a plastic wrap. A plastic wrap, “wrap,” is a thin, clear piece of plastic that I put food into, and we call it a wrap, “wrap,” because we put it around something. To wrap something is to put something around it, usually to keep it cold, or to keep it warm, or to keep it fresh when we are talking about food. We use that same word, wrap, for putting paper around a present or a gift that you are giving someone. The paper is called wrapping paper. You can also put food in aluminum foil. Aluminum, “aluminum,” is a kind of metal. It's usually a silver color. Foil, “foil,” is like a plastic wrap but it's made from aluminum. It's a - it's like a long, flat sheet that you can put around something to keep the food in your refrigerator or in your freezer, where you have even colder temperatures. At the end of the story, I dry the pans, the plates, the glasses, and the silverware. The silverware, remember, is the spoon, knife, fork that you use when you eat. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a regular speed. [Start of story] When I get home, I start on dinner right away. I clean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries and decide to make pasta. I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home. I put some water in a pan and turn the burner on high. When the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad. Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!” She comes into the kitchen, and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce. She stirs the sauce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad. I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table. I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us. About 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about our long day. My wife says she’ll do the dishes, since I cooked, but of course I help out by drying them. First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container and some in plastic wrap and the rest in aluminum foil. Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses, and silverware. [End of story] That concludes part eight of “A Day in the Life of Jeff.” In part nine we'll talk about relaxing, looking at your mail, and taking out the trash.

I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California. In part eight of this series we prepared dinner and ate dinner, and then we washed up or cleaned the dishes. In this part, we're going to relax after dinner and watch a little TV. Let's get started. [Start of story] With the dinner dishes done, my wife and I each sit down on the couch to chill out and watch the national news which comes on at 6:30. During the newscast, I sort through the day’s mail. Most of it is junk mail and bills. There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area. I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages. I like to watch TV and my wife likes to watch reality shows. One thing I hate is having to watch all of the commercials, so I turn the sound down when they come on. After the show is over, I thumb through the latest issue of the Atlantic Monthly, while my wife reads a novel by her favorite mystery writer. At around 9, I remember that tomorrow is trash day, so I take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well. I roll the trash container out to the street ready for the garbage trucks, which come by early in the morning. [End of story] Part nine is called “Relaxing, the Mail, and the Trash.” We begin with the sentence “With the dinner dishes done,” the dinner dishes are the dishes we use to eat our dinner, and when I say they are done, I mean that they are washed and dried. So, “With the dinner dishes” washed and dried, “my wife and I sit down on the couch to chill out.” To chill, “chill,” out, “out,” (two words) means to relax. Sometimes we use this expression as a command. If someone is very excited, you may say, “Hey, chill out,” means relax, don't be so excited. You will also hear just the word chill. “Hey, chill,” that's informal for relax, don't be so excited. You will also hear people say, “I'm just chilling.” I am just chilling means I'm just relaxing. Again, that's very informal. Well, my wife and I are chilling, and we're watching the national news. The national news is the news broadcast on television, and in Los Angeles, this is at 6:30 in the evening - it comes on at 6:30. When we say a television show comes on, we mean that that is when it begins - that is when you can watch it. The national news can also be called a newscast, “newscast.” A newscast is a news program. You could have a local newscast, with just news about Los Angeles, for me, or a national newscast. Well, “During the newscast, I sort through the day’s mail.” To sort, “sort,” through means that I am looking at today's mail and usually I am separating it so that I separate the different kinds of mail - the different kinds of letters - that I got that day. Most of my mail - and this is true - is either junk mail or bills. Junk, “junk,” mail is mail that you get that you don't want. Usually it is advertisements, people trying to get you to buy something; we call that junk mail. Most of my mail is either junk mail or it's bills, and a bill is a statement - a piece of paper from some company that you have to pay money to. You get a bill for your electricity, for your phone, for your Internet access. You have to pay your bills. Well, you should pay your bills; maybe you don't. “There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area.” A flier, “flier,” (the plural is fliers, with an “s”) is an advertisement - it's an announcement or an advertisement. Usually it's one or two pages - one or two pieces of paper. Sometimes the advertisements, or the fliers, are folded up. And, it's very popular for people who are selling houses to use fliers that they mail you or they put on your house - outside of your house. These fliers are for houses that people are selling - “houses for sale in the area.” “I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages.” “I check” - I look out at “the front stoop.” A stoop, “stoop,” is the stairs in front of your house. Often this word is used when we are talking about large buildings - apartment buildings or condominium buildings. In New York or Boston, some of the cities on the eastern coast of the United States, people talk about sitting on the stoop, that mean you're sitting on your stairs. But, you can also use the word to talk about your own stairs in front of your house. The top of those stairs is where you might find packages. A package, “package,” is usually a box or something that is bigger than just a regular letter that you receive in the mail or that is delivered to you by some private company. Well, I look at my stoop and I see “there are no packages” - no one loves me; no one sent me a package. I then talk about how I like to watch television, and so does my wife. “My wife likes to watch reality shows.” A reality show, “reality,” is a type of television show where they have a competition or a contest. “Big Brother” and “American Idol” are two examples of popular reality shows. They take people - average people, they say - and they have a competition or a contest. “One thing I hate” about watching television - something I don't like - “is having to watch all the commercials.” A commercial is the same as an advertisement on television or radio; it's an announcement from a company that wants you to buy what they are selling. Well, I don't like watching the commercials, “so I turn the sound down.” To turn the sound down means to lower the volume, to make it so that it is less loud - it is quieter. “I turn the sound down when” the commercials “come on.” Again, that verb, to come on, means that they are on the television - that they start. “After the show is over,” - after the show is done - finished - “I thumb through the latest issue of the Atlantic Monthly.” The Atlantic Monthly is a monthly magazine in the United States. To thumb through something, “thumb” through (two words) means to look through something, but usually not to be paying too much attention. You're sort of looking but you're not necessarily reading very carefully. We use that expression - that verb - when we are talking about magazines in particular. You're looking at them, perhaps waiting in a doctor's office - in the waiting room of a doctor's office you thumb through the magazines. Well, I'm thumbing through the Atlantic Monthly, and my wife is reading a novel. A novel, “novel,” is a fictional book - a book that is not a true story. “At around 9,” that is at nine p.m., “I remember that tomorrow is trash day.” Trash, “trash,” is anything that you are getting rid of - that you are throwing out - that you don't want anymore, and trash day is the day that the garbage trucks come by and take the trash away. Now, in Los Angeles we have a public trash service, so that the government has trucks that it sends out, and it picks up your trash - it takes your trash and puts it into the truck, and then takes it away. That is trash day. In my neighborhood it is on Fridays and every neighborhood is different, they do a different part of the city each day. So, this is trash day and I need to “take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well.” The garbage, “garbage,” is just another word for trash. We sometimes talk about garbage that is trash in the kitchen in particular. This is the kitchen garbage, and I have to take it out, meaning I have to take the bag and put it outside so that the garbage truck can come by and pick it up. In Los Angeles, and in many cities, we also have recycling bins. To recycle, “recycle,” means to use again, and in Los Angeles, we have a recycling bin where you can put your newspapers and other things that they can use again - they can recycle. A bin, “bin,” is just another name for a box, usually a plastic box. In my city, we have trash containers that you can roll; they have little wheels on them. A container is like a big box that you put something in, and so a trash container is a big, in my case, plastic box that has wheels that I can then put it down on the street. You have to put your trash containers on the street. Each container has a different color. In my case, black is the color for trash; blue is the color for recycling trash, so newspapers, for example; and green is where you put things like leaves and grass, things that you have in your - outside of your house that you want to get rid of, that are plants, that sort of thing. I put the trash containers out on the street because the garbage trucks “come by early in the morning.” They come by, a two word verb, which means that they come to your house - they drive to your house. And, in my neighborhood, they come by very early, so at six o'clock on Friday morning I can hear the trucks outside my window. I don't like it, but I need to have my trash taken away, so one day of the week I wake up early because I can hear the garbage trucks outside. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech. [Start of story] With the dinner dishes done, my wife and I each sit down on the couch to chill out and watch the national news which comes on at 6:30. During the newscast, I sort through the day’s mail. Most of it is junk mail and bills. There are also several fliers for houses for sale in the area. I check the front stoop and see that there are no packages. I like to watch TV and my wife likes to watch reality shows.

At around 9, I remember that tomorrow is trash day, so I take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well. I roll the trash container out to the street ready for the garbage trucks, which come by early in the morning.

I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California. In part nine of this series we relaxed, read our mail, and took out the trash. In this tenth and final episode, we're going to get ready for bed and go to sleep. Let's get started. [Start of story] At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed. When I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story. I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday. I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap. I wash my face, and dry it with my towel. I floss and brush my teeth. I have to admit that by this time, I’m beat, and so is my wife. She cleans up when I’ve finished up. In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get undressed. I put my dirty clothes in the hamper and I put on my pajamas. Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water to put next to the bed in case I need it during the night. I pull back the covers, fluff my pillow, and climb into bed. I set my alarm clock for 6:15, and turn off the overhead light. I lay my head down and pull up the covers, kissing my wife goodnight. Some nights I have trouble falling asleep, but tonight, I didn’t need to count any sheep. I nod off right away and before long, I’m fast asleep. [End of story] This episode is called \"Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep.\" \"At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed,\" to do the things I need to do so I can go to sleep. \"When I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.\" Bedtime, \"bedtime,\" (all one word) is, of course, the time that you go to bed - that you go to your bed so you can sleep. A bedtime story is a story you would tell a child to help them fall asleep. Many children like to be told a bedtime story. These are often what we would call fairy tales, \"fairy\" tales, \"tales.\" A tale is just another word for a story, and a fairy tale is a story about something that isn't true, usually with imaginary characters. \"I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday.\" \"I’m looking forward to having that ritual,\" a ritual, \"ritual,\" is something that you do on a regular schedule or at a regular time every day or maybe every week or every month, and you do the exact same things in the exact same order. We also use that word, ritual, when we are talking about some religious ceremonies. Some religious events have certain rules - certain order - a certain order that they follow, and that is a ritual. \"I go into the bathroom and I turn on the tap.\" The tap, \"tap,\" is the same as the faucet. Well, you turn on the tap so the water comes out, \"I wash my face, and dry it with my towel.\" I dry my face - I make it dry using a towel, \"towel,\" which is a cloth that you use to dry yourself or to clean yourself. I floss my teeth and I brush them. \"I have to admit that by this time, I’m beat.\" \"I have to admit\" is an expression that we use when you're going to say something that maybe you don't want to say - you don't want to tell the truth. In fact, there's also an expression, \"to tell the truth.\" So, I have to admit means I have to say - to tell the truth. \"By this time,\" meaning by 10:30 - \"by this time, I’m beat.\" To be beat, \"beat,\" means to be very tired. Someone says, \"Oh, I'm beat,\" they've been working all day or they've, like me, been watching television all day, and now I'm beat - I'm tired. Of course, I don't watch television all day, just part of the day! Well, my wife is also beat. In the story I say, \"I'm beat, and so is my wife,\" meaning my wife is also very tired. \"She cleans up when I’ve finished up.\" Once again, you see those two word verbs. To clean up is, in this case, to clean your face, to brush your teeth; to get yourself clean is to clean up. To finish up is really the same as to finish, but we love in English to use those prepositions as part of these two word verbs. So, I finish up, meaning I finish doing what I need to do, and then my wife goes into the bathroom and cleans up. \"In the meantime,\" meaning while my wife is doing that, \"in the meantime,\" \"meantime,\" (all one word) \"I walk into the bedroom and get undressed.\" So, when my wife is in the bathroom, \"I walk\" - at the same time - \"into the bedroom and I get undressed.\" To get undressed is the opposite of to get dressed. So, if you get undressed, you take off your clothes. \"I put my dirty clothes\" - the clothes I was wearing - \"in the hamper and I put on my pajamas.\" A hamper, \"hamper,\" as a noun, is a place, usually in your bedroom or bathroom, where you put dirty clothes or dirty towels; we call that a hamper. To hamper, as a verb, means something different. To hamper someone means to get in their way - to prevent them from doing something. But as a noun, a hamper, or a clothes hamper, is a place, usually it's a big plastic box with a top on it, or it could be made of wood, and that's where you put your dirty clothes. And then, at some point during the week, I hope, you wash your clothes so you can have clean clothes again. Unless, of course, you're not married, in which case, if you are a man and single, you may not wash your clothes that much. Well, I have \"my dirty clothes in my hamper,\" and since I don't have any clothes on, remember I have undressed, \"I put on my pajamas.\" Pajamas, \"pajamas,\" are sometimes abbreviated as PJs, \"PJ\" PJs. Your pajamas, or PJs, are the clothes that you wear when you are going to bed. For example, I have pajamas that say Superman on it, and I wear my Superman pajamas to bed. Doesn't everyone? Well, in addition to putting on my pajamas, I also put on my slippers. A slipper, \"slipper,\" is a shoe that you wear usually just inside the house. So, when you are getting ready for bed and you want to walk around the house, you don't put your shoes on, you would put some slippers on. Some people wear slippers in their house, especially if the floors are cold, and they'll put the slippers on at night and have them on at night as they walk around in their house or in the morning. Well, \"Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water,\" and I want to put that water \"next to my bed in case I need it during the night.\" So, if I need to drink water at night, I have a glass of water next to me. \"I pull back the covers.\" The covers, \"covers,\" are the blanket, the comforter, and the top sheets. We take those things and we have to pull them back. To pull back means to take them and move them towards the bottom of the bed so that you can get in, and after you get in, you're going to pull the covers up. So, you pull back the covers to get into the bed, and then you pull them up to cover you again so you can stay warm. \"I pull back my covers,\" and I \"fluff my pillow.\" The pillow is what I put my head on. To fluff, \"fluff,\" means to make your pillow bigger by hitting it very softly on the sides. So, you take your pillow and you put one hand on each side of the pillow and you move your hands back and forth toward each other and away from each other, and that allows the pillow to be a little bigger - to be a little softer. \"I fluff my pillow, and I climb into bed.\" Notice that verb to climb, \"climb,\" into bed. It means the same as to get into bed. We might use that particular verb, to climb into, if we are very tired, for example. You can also use it just to mean to get into bed. So, I \"climb into bed. I set my alarm clock for 6:15,\" - for 6:15 in the morning, of course - \"and I turn off the overhead light.\" The overhead, \"overhead,\" (all one word) is a light that is on the top of your room - on the ceiling of the room. The top of the room is called the ceiling, \"ceiling.\" So, an overhead light is on the top of the ceiling - or on the ceiling, and I turn the overhead light off. \"I lay my head down.\" To lay, \"lay,\" here means to put something down. Usually we use that verb when we are talking about people or a part of your body. \"I lay my head down and I pull up the covers,\" so I am warm, and because I'm such a great husband, I kiss \"my wife goodnight.\" To kiss someone goodnight means to kiss them and, in a sense, to say goodnight to them. \" Some nights I have trouble falling asleep.\" To fall, \"fall,\" asleep, \"asleep,\" means to go to sleep - to start sleeping. Sometimes \"I have trouble falling asleep, but tonight, I didn’t need to count any sheep.\" The expression to count sheep, \"sheep,\" is used because we traditionally when we are trying to fall asleep, some people say that it helps if you try counting numbers, so you start with one, two, three, four. And, for some reason, I don't know why, it is traditional to count sheep. Sheep are a type of animal. A sheep is an animal that you take the hair off of, and you use the hair of the sheep to make clothing, for example. I don't need to count sheep because I'm very tired. If you are not tired or you have difficulty falling asleep, you might want to try counting sheep. One, two, three, four, and by the time you reach five million you should be asleep! \"I nod off right away.\" To nod, \"nod,\" off (two words) means the same as to fall asleep. It's just another way of saying fall asleep, \"I nod off.\" Sometimes people will use that expression when they're at a meeting and it is very boring at work, and you may say to someone, \"I almost nodded off\" - I almost fell asleep. That usually happens to my students when I am teaching. \"Before long,\" meaning in a very short time, \"before long, I’m fast asleep.\" To be fast, \"fast,\" asleep means to be completely asleep. There's a similar expression that means the same, to be sound asleep, \"sound.\" To be sound asleep means that you are sleeping completely, it will not be easy to wake you up. Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech. [Start of story] At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed. When I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story. I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday. I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap. I wash my face, and dry it with my towel. I floss and brush my teeth. I have to admit that by this time, I’m beat, and so is my wife. She cleans up when I’ve finished up. In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get undressed. I put my dirty clothes in the hamper and I put on my pajamas. Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water to put next to the bed in case I need it during the night. I pull back the covers, fluff my pillow, and climb into bed. I set my alarm clock for 6:15, and turn off the overhead light. I lay my head down and pull up the covers, kissing my wife goodnight. Some nights I have trouble falling asleep, but tonight, I didn’t need to count any sheep. I nod off right away and before long, I’m fast asleep.
